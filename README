-----------------------------------------------
This software is written using the Qt4 GUI toolkit. It can display the contents of the file in which the DigiMemo saves it's data. At the moment this is all it does, since it is very early alpha (it's only a few hours worth of coding) but in the future it will be a clone (feature-wise) of the Windows software MyNotes that ACECAD distributes for the DigiMemo. This includes for example OCR software.
